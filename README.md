# oof-bot
Discord bot that says "oof" whenever someone speaks. Written with discord.py

## The way oofs work
The bot will oof anyone who speaks under a channel it can see and speak on, but users with a role by the name of "unfoofable" will be ignored.

That's basically all there is to this bot, really.


## Have some feedback?
Use the feedback command to tell me things that would make the bot better in any way. But keep any feedback and suggestions being sent only through this command and not my personal discord PMs.

## Sidenote
You can run this bot yourself if you have a bot account token. Just pass it as the one and only argument when running `oof.py` on the terminal.
